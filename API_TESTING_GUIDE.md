## ðŸ§ª **Additional Test Cases**

### **Test Multiple Carriers Accepting**
1. Create mission (Shipper)
2. Set price and confirm (Shipper)
3. Accept mission with Carrier 1
4. Accept mission with Carrier 2
5. Check dashboard shows 2 carriers
6. Select Carrier 1
7. Verify Carrier 2's acceptance is marked as rejected

### **Test Error Cases**
- Try to set price below current price
- Try to confirm mission that's not in CREATED status
- Try to accept mission that's not SEARCHING_CARRIER
- Try to select carrier who didn't accept
- Try to access endpoints with wrong user type

### **Test Authorization**
- Try shipper endpoints with carrier JWT
- Try carrier endpoints with shipper JWT
- Try endpoints without JWT

---

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Database Changes**

### **MissionAcceptance Table**
```sql
-- After carrier accepts mission
INSERT INTO mission_acceptances (id, mission_id, carrier_id, status, created_at)
VALUES ('cmg7mcbp0001fiha47jb9w2um', 'cmg7mcbp0000fiha47jb9w2um', 'cmg7m945w0003iha43atwmx96', 'PENDING', NOW());

-- After shipper selects carrier
UPDATE mission_acceptances 
SET status = 'ACCEPTED' 
WHERE mission_id = 'cmg7mcbp0000fiha47jb9w2um' AND carrier_id = 'cmg7m945w0003iha43atwmx96';

UPDATE mission_acceptances 
SET status = 'REJECTED' 
WHERE mission_id = 'cmg7mcbp0000fiha47jb9w2um' AND carrier_id != 'cmg7m945w0003iha43atwmx96';
```

### **Mission Table**
```sql
-- After shipper selects carrier
UPDATE missions 
SET carrier_id = 'cmg7m945w0003iha43atwmx96', status = 'ACCEPTED' 
WHERE id = 'cmg7mcbp0000fiha47jb9w2um';
```
